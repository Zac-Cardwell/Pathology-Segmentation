# Pathology Segmentation

This project focuses on segmenting different cancer Whole Slide Images (WSI) using DeepLab and U-Net models. The goal is to accurately identify and delineate pathological regions within medical images for diagnostic and research purposes.

## Overview

Pathology segmentation plays a crucial role in medical image analysis by automating the process of identifying and analyzing cancerous tissues in digital pathology slides. This repository implements two main segmentation models:

- **DeepLab**: A state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for semantic image segmentation, capable of capturing fine details.
  
- **U-Net**: A popular architecture for biomedical image segmentation, known for its ability to perform well with limited data and produce precise segmentations.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Includes tools and scripts for preprocessing WSI data, handling large-scale image datasets, and converting annotations.
  
- **Model Implementation**: Provides implementations of DeepLab and U-Net models using TensorFlow (or PyTorch, depending on your implementation choice).

- **Training and Evaluation**: Scripts for training the models on annotated datasets, evaluating segmentation performance using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU), and visualizing results.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
